# Bejeweled Project 1
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a functional browser game that can perform the least amount of actions for a MVP. 
  
The Player needs to evaluate the board elements, select 2 gems that must be next to each other that will switch positions. The game will then evaluate if there are 3 or more instances of the same element in a row or/and a column. If found, it applies a score that will depend on the number of gems found and then the game will remove these gems from the board and slide down the ones above. If another combination of the same gem happens, the game continue to apply a score and move the gems above the combination down. The player has 30 seconds to play.
